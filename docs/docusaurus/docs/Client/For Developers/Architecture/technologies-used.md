# Technologies Used

The R-Type project leverages a variety of modern technologies and tools to create a robust and efficient game engine. Here's an overview of the key technologies used in the project:

## Programming Language
- **C++**: The core language used for developing the game engine, client, and server components.

## Graphics and Multimedia
- **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**: Used for handling graphics, window management, and multimedia functionalities.

## Build System
- **CMake**: Cross-platform build system used to generate platform-specific build files.

## Version Control
- **Git**: Distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code.
- **GitHub**: Hosting platform for version control and collaboration.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **GitHub Actions**: Used for automating build, test, and deployment processes.

## Documentation
- **Docusaurus**: Documentation generator used for creating and maintaining project documentation.
- **Markdown**: Lightweight markup language used for writing documentation.

## Game Architecture
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Architecture pattern used for organizing game logic and data.

## Asset Management
- **Custom JSON-based map format**: Used for defining and loading game maps and levels.

## Networking
- (Specific networking library or protocol, if used)

## Development Tools
- **ccache**: Optional compiler cache for speeding up recompilation.

## Testing
- (Specific testing framework, if used)

## Audio
- **SFML Audio module**: Used for handling music and sound effects in the game.

## Configuration
- **JSON**: Used for configuration files, including map definitions.

## License
- **MIT License**: The open-source license under which the project is distributed.

These technologies work together to create a modern, efficient, and maintainable game engine for R-Type. Each technology has been chosen to address specific needs of the project, from cross-platform compatibility to ease of development and deployment.
