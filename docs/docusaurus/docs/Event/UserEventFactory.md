# EventFactory Class

## Overview
The `EventFactory` class is like a factory that makes different types of **events** based on what it receives from the network. Think of it as a magical machine that takes in **messages** and **data** and turns them into events that the game can understand.

## What Does EventFactory Do?

Imagine youâ€™re in a game and players are moving, shooting, or sending chat messages. The `EventFactory` helps take those activities and turn them into **event objects** so the game knows what happened.

For example:
- A player moved? `EventFactory` makes a **PlayerMovement** event.
- A player sent a message? `EventFactory` makes a **ChatMessage** event.
- A new enemy appeared? `EventFactory` makes an **EntitySpawn** event.

## How to Use EventFactory

To use the `EventFactory`, you call its `createEvent` method. This method takes in some data (like a **message header** and a **payload**) and creates the right kind of event for you.

### Example: Creating an Event from Data

Letâ€™s say you received a message saying that a player has moved. Hereâ€™s how you can use `EventFactory` to create an event:

```cpp
GDTPHeader header;
header.messageType = 0x01; // Message type for PlayerMovement
std::vector<uint8_t> payload = { ... }; // Some data about the movement

EventFactory factory;
Event event = factory.createEvent(header, payload);
```

Now, `event` will hold information about the playerâ€™s movement!

## Types of Events You Can Create

The `EventFactory` can create many types of events based on the message type:

- **0x01 - Player Movement**: When a player moves somewhere.
- **0x05 - Player Shoot**: When a player fires a weapon.
- **0x15 - Chat Message**: When a player sends a message in the game.
- **0x06 - Player Health Update**: When a player's health changes.
- **0x09 - Entity Spawn**: When a new enemy or object appears.
- **0x0A - Entity Destroy**: When something disappears from the game.

The `EventFactory` reads the `messageType` in the **header** to decide which event to make.

## Checking for Mistakes

The `EventFactory` also makes sure that the data it receives is the right size. If the data is too small or doesn't match what it expects, it throws an **error**. This helps prevent the game from getting confused by incomplete or wrong messages.

### Example: Handling Mistakes

```cpp
try {
    Event event = factory.createEvent(header, payload);
    // Now you have your event!
} catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {
    std::cerr << "Oops! Something went wrong: " << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

## Summary

The `EventFactory` is like a translator for the game. It takes in raw data and turns it into meaningful events that the game can act on. It helps the game understand when players move, shoot, chat, or when new things appear or disappear.

With the `EventFactory`, your game stays in sync with whatâ€™s happening and can react to changes quickly.
