# Event Class

## Overview
The `Event` class is like a message that contains information about something that happened in the game, such as a player moving, a player sending a chat message, or an entity appearing on the screen. Each event has a **type** and, depending on the type, different kinds of information.

## What Is an Event?

An event has two important parts:

- **Type**: This tells us what kind of event it is (e.g., a player moving, a chat message).
- **Payload**: This is the extra information that goes along with the event, like which player moved and where.

## How to Create an Event

Creating an `Event` is like writing a little note about something that happened. Hereâ€™s how to create different types of events:

### Example 1: A Player Moves

Letâ€™s say we want to create an event that says player 1 moved to a new position:

```cpp
PlayerMovement movement = {1, 100.0f, 200.0f, 0.0f}; // Player 1 moves to (100, 200, 0)
Event moveEvent(0x01, movement);
```

### Example 2: A Player Sends a Chat Message

If a player sends a message in the game, we can create an event like this:

```cpp
ChatMessage chat = {1, "Hello, world!"}; // Player 1 says "Hello, world!"
Event chatEvent(0x15, chat);
```

### Example 3: A New Entity Appears

If a new enemy or object appears in the game, we can create an event for that:

```cpp
EntitySpawn spawn = {42, 50.0f, 75.0f}; // An entity with ID 42 spawns at (50, 75)
Event spawnEvent(0x09, spawn);
```

## Checking the Event Type

Once you have an event, you might want to know what kind of event it is:

```cpp
if (moveEvent.getType() == 0x01) {
    std::cout << "This event is about a player moving!" << std::endl;
}
```

## Getting the Eventâ€™s Information

To get the details of what happened in an event, you can use `getPayload()`:

```cpp
auto payload = moveEvent.getPayload();

if (std::holds_alternative<PlayerMovement>(payload)) {
    PlayerMovement movement = std::get<PlayerMovement>(payload);
    std::cout << "Player ID: " << movement.playerId
              << " moved to X: " << movement.x
              << " Y: " << movement.y
              << " Z: " << movement.z << std::endl;
}
```

## Types of Events

Here are some of the types of events you might encounter:

- **Player Movement (0x01)**: When a player moves somewhere.
- **Chat Message (0x15)**: When a player sends a message in the chat.
- **Player Shoot (0x05)**: When a player fires a weapon.
- **Player Health Update (0x06)**: When a player's health changes.
- **Entity Spawn (0x09)**: When a new entity appears in the game.
- **Entity Destroy (0x0A)**: When an entity is removed from the game.

## Summary

The `Event` class helps you track whatâ€™s happening in the game. It lets you know when players move, chat, or when entities appear or disappear. Using events makes it easier to keep track of whatâ€™s going on and respond to changes in the game.
