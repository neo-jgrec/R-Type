# Project Objectives

The R-Type project aims to recreate the classic side-scrolling shooter game while incorporating modern development practices and technologies. Here are the main objectives of the project:

1. **Game Recreation**: Develop a faithful recreation of the R-Type game, maintaining its core gameplay mechanics and visual style.

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure the game runs smoothly on multiple platforms, leveraging SFML for graphics and system interactions.

3. **Modular Architecture**: Implement a component-based entity system for flexible game object management and easy extensibility.

4. **Map Editor**: Create a robust map editor tool that allows for easy creation and modification of game levels, supporting various tile sets and obstacle placements.

5. **Networking**: Implement multiplayer functionality, allowing players to enjoy the game cooperatively or competitively over a network.

6. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for both users and developers, covering game features, development guidelines, and project structure.

7. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Utilize GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and deployment of the game and its documentation.

8. **Asset Management**: Develop a system for efficient loading and management of game assets, including graphics, music, and sound effects.

9. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure the game runs smoothly at 60 FPS on target platforms, with efficient rendering and game logic processing.

10. **Extensibility**: Design the game architecture to allow for easy addition of new features, levels, and game modes in the future.

These objectives aim to create a high-quality, maintainable, and enjoyable R-Type game that stays true to the original while leveraging modern development practices and technologies.
