# Accessibility Report

## Introduction
This section assesses the accessibility features of our R-Type game and highlights areas where improvements can be made. Currently, the game includes **volume controls** and **customizable keybindings**. Future plans involve broader accessibility improvements across multiple areas: **general accessibility**, **audio and visual impairments**, and **mental and cognitive disabilities**.

## Current Accessibility Features
